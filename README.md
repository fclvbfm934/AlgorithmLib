# AlgorithmLib
This project is a static library for C++. It contains mathematical objects such as Polynomials, Fractions, Permutations, as well as implementations for different algorithms. 

Documentation is being built up on the wiki. Check it out!

##Using this library
The compiled static library, `libAlgorithms.a`, is included in the root directory of this repo. You should download/clone the repo. Add `libAlgorithms.a` as a static library that your project will use and then make sure to have it search the `include` directory, since that is where the header files are. 

## Upcoming classes (maybe)
* Matrices
* Groups
* Rings
